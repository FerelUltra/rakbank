The app has been made with vite.
The app reason is test assessment to Rakbank.
I have not created unit tests due to time limit I have.
Also did not make as instruction directs (for example, no pictures in config, only text. Pictures of estimations are hardcoded).
Tasks "Animate and display the label on hover on the
options" and "Once the option is selected (by clicking), highlight
and show the label" I did not get. I 
Also mock api I did for non-existing url, but in my opinion, it is enough.
To check out the app you need to download classically, install npm packages and run command 'vite'
